## Objective
Create a Tool for Voice Based Medicine Prescriptions in order to prevent spreading of any contagious diseases through hand-written prescriptions

---

## Implementation
Implemented Speech2Text and Text2Speech Functionality in 
three different forms : 
- Web Application
- Graphical User Interface (GUI)
- Command Line Interface (CLI)

Our main focus is to provide the same application experience for all users.

---

## Experimentation
- Create Automatic bots so that users need not to provide any commands to the application and provide a fast-learning experience
- Convert Synchronous Speak and Recognition API functionality to Asynchronous and then created a special wait function to make them Synchronous

## Conclusion

We successfully implemented Speech2Text and 
Text2Speech Functionality in three different versions.

Our Project focuses on providing a better method to 
provide medical prescriptions allowing doctors to prevent 
any kind of physical contact with Infected and NonInfected People.
